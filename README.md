**Abstract:** We introduce PanDerm, a multimodal dermatology foundation model addressing the challenge that current deep learning models excel only at specific tasks rather than meeting the complex, multimodal requirements of clinical dermatology practice. Pretrained through self-supervised learning on over 2 million skin disease images across four imaging modalities from multiple institutions, PanDerm demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, including skin cancer screening, differential diagnosis, lesion segmentation, longitudinal monitoring, and prognosis prediction, often requiring less labeled data than existing approaches. Clinical reader studies show PanDerm outperforms clinicians in early melanoma detection, improves dermatologists' diagnostic skin cancer diagnosis accuracy, and enhances non-specialists' differential diagnosis capabilities across numerous skin conditions.

## About PanDerm

_**What is PanDerm?**_ PanDerm is a vision-centric multimodal foundation model pretrained on 2 million dermatological images. It provides specialized representations across four dermatological imaging modalities (dermoscopy, clinical images, TBP, and dermatopathology), delivering superior performance in skin cancer diagnosis, differential diagnosis of hundreds of skin conditions, disease progression monitoring, Total Body Photography-based applications, and image segmentation.

_**Why use PanDerm?**_ PanDerm significantly outperforms clinically popular CNN models like ResNet, especially with limited labeled data. Its strong linear probing results offer a computationally efficient alternative with lower implementation barriers. PanDerm also demonstrates superior performance compared to existing foundation models while minimizing data leakage risk—a common concern with web-scale pretrained models like DINOv2, SwavDerm, and Derm Foundation. These combined advantages make PanDerm the ideal choice for replacing both traditional CNNs and other foundation models in clinical applications, including human-AI collaboration, multimodal image analysis, and various diagnostic and progression tasks.

_**Note**_: PanDerm is a general-purpose dermatology foundation model and requires fine-tuning or linear probing before application to specific tasks.

## 2. Data Preparation

<details>
  <summary>
  <b>Using Your Own Dataset</b>
  </summary>
  
If you wish to use our model with your own dataset, the dataset used for linear probing or finetuning should be organized in a CSV file with the following structure:

**Required Columns**
- `image`: Path to the image file (e.g., ISIC_0034524.jpg)
- `split`: Dataset partition indicator (train, val, or test)
- For multi-class classification:
  - `label`: Numerical class label (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
- For binary classification:
  - `binary_label`: Binary class label (e.g., 0, 1)

For Multi-class Example:
```csv
image,label,split
ISIC_0034524.jpg,1,train
ISIC_0034525.jpg,1,train
ISIC_0034526.jpg,4,val
ISIC_0034527.jpg,3,test
```

For Binary Classification Example:
```csv
image,binary_label,split
ISIC_0034524.jpg,1,train
ISIC_0034525.jpg,1,train
ISIC_0034526.jpg,0,val
ISIC_0034527.jpg,0,test
```

### Recommended Configuration for fine-tuning

Our experiments show the following hyperparameters deliver optimal performance across various evaluation datasets:
- Batch size: 128
- Learning rate: 5e-4
- Training epochs: 50
- Enable the weighted random sampler
- Enable TTA during testing 
  
We observed that the hyperparameter setting is robust across datasets and typically doesn't require adjustment.

### Start Training

You could fine-tune PanDerm on your dataset. Here is a command-line example for fine-tuning PanDerm_Large on the PAD-UFES dataset:


```bash
MODEL_NAME="PanDerm_Large_FT"
MODEL_PATH="/path/to/your/PanDerm/pretrain_weight/panderm_ll_data6_checkpoint-499.pth"

CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 run_class_finetuning.py \
    --model $MODEL_NAME \
    --pretrained_checkpoint $MODEL_PATH \
    --nb_classes 6 \
    --batch_size 128 \
    --lr 5e-4 \
    --update_freq 1 \
    --warmup_epochs 10 \
    --epochs 50 --layer_decay 0.65 --drop_path 0.2 \
    --weight_decay 0.05 --mixup 0.8 --cutmix 1.0 \
    --weights \
    --sin_pos_emb \
    --no_auto_resume \
    --exp_name exp_name "pad finetune and eval" \
    --imagenet_default_mean_and_std \
    --wandb_name "Reproduce_PAD_FT_${seed}" \
    --output_dir /path/to/your/PanDerm/Evaluation_datasets/PAD_Res/ \ # Your best epoch's fine-tuned checkpoint and model output results on the test set will be saved in this directory
    --csv_path "/path/to/your/PanDerm/Evaluation_datasets/pad-ufes/2000.csv" \
    --root_path "/path/to/your/PanDerm/Evaluation_datasets/pad-ufes/images/ " \
    --seed 0 
```

The script for fine-tuning and evaluating PanDerm:

```bash
cd classification
bash script/finetune_train.sh 
```
Note: Remember to adjust the `pretrained_checkpoint` argument to your storage location of pretrained model weights.

### Evaluation
```bash
cd classification
bash script/finetune_test.sh
```
Note: Remember to adjust the `resume` argument to your storage location of finetuned model weights.
